Functional programming in C++

Playing around with the concepts of functional programming. 

This is a small library aimed at making it easer to add some functional programming style to C++ code.

In some sense it is just a wrapper for the functional stl library

Inspired from a talk on functional programming I attended and the idea of using function pointers to create higher-order functions in C\C++.
